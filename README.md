Sure, I can help you edit your GitHub profile to represent you as a Python and Web3 developer. Here's a revised version:

👋 Hi, I'm @pkagwe, a Python and Web3 developer with a passion for blockchain technology.

👀 I'm interested in creating decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and exploring the potential of blockchain in various industries.

🌱 I'm currently learning the ins and outs of Starknet, Polkadot, and other blockchain technologies to build secure and efficient decentralized solutions.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Python, Web3, and blockchain. If you have an interesting project or idea, feel free to reach out!

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me through GitHub or reach out via email at [YourEmail@example.com]. Let's connect and work on exciting blockchain projects together!
